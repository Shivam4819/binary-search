These are the basic program written in c++.These programs are based on Binary 
Search tree.

1)create binary search tree and display smallest element in the tree.
   files->
	>MinimumValue.h
	>Minimumvalue.cpp

2)create a binary search tree using array and display the tree in asscending 
  order.
   files->
	>ArrayBst.h
	>Arraybst.cpp
3)create two binary search tree and merge them.
   files->
       >MergeBst.h
       >Mergebst.cpp
4)create a binary tree and then take two keys and print all value between that keys.
   files->
       >BstKeyInRange.h
       >Bstkeyinrange.cpp
       
5)create a binary search tree and find the height of left and right subtree.
   file->
       >HeightOfSubtree.h
       >Heightofsubtree.cpp
       
6)create a binary search tree and find the successor of the particular data of the tree.
    file->
       >Successor.h
       >Successor.cpp
